## What does the app do?

The **Racetrack Info-Screens** system provides real-time updates and interfaces for managing races and informing guests at the Beachside Racetrack. The system automates tasks like race setup, lap tracking, and displaying race updates for spectators, reducing the reliance on staff.

Key features include:

- **Real-time communication**: Powered by Socket.IO for instant updates.
- **Role-specific interfaces**: Tailored for employees (e.g., Safety Officials) and guests (e.g., Race Drivers).
- **Public displays**: Show race progress, lap times, and safety statuses.
- **Simplified race management**: Configure and control races with intuitive tools.
- **Receptionist functionalities**: Add and remove races, add drivers, assign drivers to cars, and edit driver names.
- **Safety Official functionalities**: Assign races and set statuses and flags for races.
- **Lap-Line Observer functionalities**: Track when each racer completes a lap.
- **Leaderboard functionalities**: Record lap times and display standings based on the fastest lap.
- **Driver results**: At the end of the timer, drivers see their results for each lap.
- **Employee access**: Safety Officials, Receptionists, and Lap-Line Observers are employees and have their own passwords to access the interface.
- **Next Race display: Highlights the next race, showing drivers' names, their assigned cars, and instructions to proceed to the paddock.**
